# 3D_CIM_Chiplet_Architecture_Exploration
Welcome.

The ‘CIM_Chiplet_library’ folder stores CIM chiplets. In this folder, the ‘Compute_chiplet_set.json’ file stores more than 60 CIM chiplets in total, and it contains the modeling parameters which are extracted from various-devices-based CIM chips including SRAM, DRAM, RRAM, MRAM, PCM, Flash, etc. ‘Compute_chiplet_set_for_brute_force_search.json’ file contains the CIM chiplets for brute-force search. And the interconnection interfaces are also extracted in the file ‘Chiplet_interconnection_set.json’.

Since the original paper data may not be all provided, we have made reasonable assumptions about some of the data and given notes. If there is any inaccuracy, please contact us for modification.

The ‘Algorithm_model’ folder stores three types of AI algorithms, including graph computing(recommendation system), VGG16, and Vision-Transformer.
